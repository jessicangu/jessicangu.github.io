As a first-generation student and a woman in STEM, I have always approached challenges with determination and a passion for creating meaningful change. Currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science with a Minor in Mathematics at the University of Houston, I’ve developed skills in programming, database systems, and web development. My experiences—from leading initiatives to promote diversity and inclusion in high school to building impactful tech projects in college—have shaped my drive to make technology more accessible and equitable. I am committed to leveraging my skills in computer science to solve real-world problems and inspire others from underrepresented backgrounds to pursue their passions in STEM.
